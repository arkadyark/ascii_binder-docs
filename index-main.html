          <p><strong>What <em>is</em> AsciiBinder?</strong></p>
          <p>This site is all about AsciiBinder, a documentation system for people who have a lot of docs to maintain and republish on a regular basis. AsciiBinder was specifically developed to solve two problems at once:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Make it easier for developers and community members to contribute documentation.</li>
            <li>Make it easier for content managers to build and publish several variants of the same documentation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>AsciiBinder isn't for blogging.</strong></p>
          <p>If you are looking for a great tool for blogging where your articles are sourced in AsciiDoc, <em>this isn't it</em>. Seriously, go check out <a href="http://awestruct.org/">Awestruct</a>, which is awesome for that.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>AsciiBinder is for documenting versioned, interrelated projects.</strong></p>
          <p>On the other hand, if you are looking for a way to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Source your docs in AsciiDoc</li>
            <li>Manage doc changes and doc versions with git</li>
            <li>Have the ability to conditionalize topics and produce different <em>distributions</em> of the docs based on those conditions</li>
          </ul>
          <p>...then by jove, you've come to the right place.</p>
